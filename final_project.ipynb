    "# Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This final project can be collaborative. The maximum members of a group is 3. You can also work by yourself. Please respect the academic integrity. **Remember: if you get caught on cheating, you get F.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Introduction to the competition\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"news-sexisme-EN.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"380\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sexism is a growing problem online. It can inflict harm on women who are targeted, make online spaces inaccessible and unwelcoming, and perpetuate social asymmetries and injustices. Automated tools are now widely deployed to find, and assess sexist content at scale but most only give classifications for generic, high-level categories, with no further explanation. Flagging what is sexist content and also explaining why it is sexist improves interpretability, trust and understanding of the decisions that automated tools use, empowering both users and moderators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on SemEval 2023 - Task 10 - Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS). [Here](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7124#learn_the_details-overview) you can find a detailed introduction to this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to complete **TASK A - Binary Sexism Detection: a two-class (or binary) classification where systems have to predict whether a post is sexist or not sexist**. To cut down training time, we only use a subset of the original dataset (5k out of 20k). The dataset can be found in the same folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different from our previous homework, this competition gives you great flexibility (and very few hints). You can freely determine every component of your workflow, including but not limited to:\n",
    "-  **Preprocessing the input text**: You may decide how to clean or transform the text. For example, removing emojis or URLs, lowercasing, removing stopwords, applying stemming or lemmatization, correcting spelling, or performing tokenization and sentence segmentation.\n",
    "-  **Feature extraction and encoding**: You can choose any method to convert text into numerical representations, such as TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, N-grams, Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or other transformer-based models), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, dependency-based features, sentiment or emotion features, readability metrics, or even embeddings or features generated by large language models (LLMs).\n",
    "-  **Data augmentation and enrichment**: You may expand or balance your dataset by incorporating other related corpora or using techniques like synonym replacement, random deletion/insertion, or LLM-assisted augmentation (e.g., generating paraphrased or synthetic examples to improve model robustness).\n",
    "-  **Model selection**: You are free to experiment with different models — from traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) to deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers), or even hybrid/ensemble approaches that combine multiple models or leverage LLM-generated predictions or reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "-  **Input**: the text for each instance.\n",
    "-  **Output**: the binary label for each instance.\n",
    "-  **Feature engineering**: use at least 2 different methods to extract features and encode text into numerical values. You may explore both traditional and AI-assisted techniques. Data augmentation is optional.\n",
    "-  **Model selection**: implement with at least 3 different models and compare their performance.\n",
    "-  **Evaluation**: create a dataframe with rows indicating feature+model and columns indicating Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1-score (using weighted average). Your results should have at least 6 rows (2 feature engineering methods x 3 models). Report best performance with (1) your feature engineering method, and (2) the model you choose. Here is an example illustrating how the experimental results table should be presented.\n",

    "Violations will result in 0 points in the grade: \n",
    "-   `Rule 1 - No test set leakage`: You must not use any instance from the test set during training, feature engineering, or model selection.\n",
    "-   `Rule 2 - Responsible AI use`: You may use generative AI, but you must clearly document how it was used. If you have used genAI, include a section titled “Use of Generative AI” describing:\n",
    "    -   What parts of the project you used AI for\n",
    "    -   What was implemented manually vs. with AI assistance\n",

    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance should be only evaluated on the test set (a total of 1086 instances). Please split original dataset into train set and test set. The test set should NEVER be used in the training process. The evaluation metric is a combination of precision, recall, and f1-score (use `classification_report` in sklearn). \n",

    "- Top 50\\% - 75\\% teams: 7.0 points.\n",
    "- Top 75\\% - 100\\% teams: 6.0 points.\n",

    "Similar as homework, submit both a PDF and .ipynb version of the report including: \n",
    "- code and experimental results with details explained\n",
    "- combined results table, report and best performance\n",
    "- a summary at the end of the report (please follow the format above)\n",

    "Here in data preprocessing, we are mainly grabbing the CSV data and correctly parsing it using our parse() function. Due to the text portion within the csv having commas, we must split the id from the left and the label along with split column from the right and the remaining portion would be our text portion. We then use pandas Dataframe filtering to split the data set into the training and testing sets. For text preprocessing, we decided to utilize the re library to get rid of URLs and extra spacing within text as well as Python's .lower() function. After we applied the preprocessing function to the data set. We stripped the label texts as well as put them in a LabelEncoder to ease the use for our machine learning classifiers."

    "For this project, in order to research libraries we were unfamiliar with such as TF-IDF, GloVe Embeddings, Sentence-Transformers, and Voting Classifiers, AI was used to learn about these libraries. AI was also used for large level ideas on possible improvements for our Feature Engineering such as explaining what TF-IDF Vectorizer parameters would further improve our feature engineering, what GloVe embeddings to use and how to use it, also used to suggest potential flag words in our custom_features. All code for text preprocessing, models, and the evaluation was manually written. Feature engineering section used AI for selection of the model \"all-mpnet-base-v2\" for Sentence Transformers.
